limiting request threads but processing images fast may lead to instabilities in slow internet conditions, needs fix
	this doesn't happen much at all when threads aren't limited

change all threads into std::thread
revise RainCout to become RainCoutF
something is a little off with thread counts
make thread limits not 1 and 0 work
make the p_saddrinfo_www variable into a map
rebase RequestManager
add timout as a setting in config
find a better way to clean out std::threads in RequestManager
